							<p>
								Entering the fourth week, the group had access to really valuable feedback that we got back on the demo session. During the fourth week we held a meeting to discuss this feedback 
								as well as laying out a plan for how to proceed with the project. Some of the feedback we got was quite expected, such as adding a way for the player to die but we also got valuable 
								feedback on things we hadn't really considered before, such as the slight offset in the wand held by the player character and the origin point for the spell making it more difficult/frustrating 
								to aim.

								Before getting into coding and working further on the game, however, the group needed to look more into further developing the business side of the project prior to the first status update 
								for the game. For this assignment, the group had to look more into specifying what our target groups were, specifying our technical platforms as well as come up with a preliminary business plan. 
								The technical platforms were all quite straight forward, as everyone in the group had already gotten into the platforms we felt we needed in order to work on the game (These platforms being Unity; 
								for coding & building the game, Github; for version control, Aseprite; for drawing relevant pixel art & Cakewalk; for the game audio). The target group was a bit more challenging to define but at 
								the end of a long discussion during our meeting we set our preliminary definition for our target groups as people interested in skill based games as well as people looking for a game that can be 
								easily booted up and play for a couple of minutes (short/quick game sessions). Business-wise we agreed that Steam and Good old games would make for ideal distribution platforms, while potential
								competitors would be games such as Hotline miami (from where we have  taken plenty of inspiration for our game) as well as various roguelikes.
