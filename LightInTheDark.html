					<p>
						A project done for the Advanced Graphics and Interaction course at KTH between August-November of 2022. The project features asynchronous gameplay, where one player in VR
						is actively playing against another player which is interacting through a desktop. At its core, the game is a survival game as well as a sort of tower defense game at the same time.
						The VR player tries to survive for as long as possible using a fiery sword and various spells against an onslaught of monsters summoned by the desktop player who's trying to
						kill the VR player as fast as possible. Check out the <a href="https://agigroup8.github.io/"><u>project website</u></a> for more information!

					<h2>My Contributions</h2>
					<p>
						My work on this project was mainly centered around the spells used in the game, where I was responsible for the logic and scripting behind each spell.
						I was also responsible for the VFX and sound related to each spell.
