								<br />
								A project done for the Advanced Graphics and Interaction course at KTH between August-November of 2022. The project features asynchronous gameplay, where one player in VR
								is actively playing against another player which is interacting through a desktop. At its core, the game is a survival game as well as a sort of tower defense game at the same time.
								The VR player tries to survive for as long as possible using a fiery sword and various spells against an onslaught of monsters summoned by the desktop player who's trying to
								kill the VR player as fast as possible. Check out the  <a href="https://agigroup8.github.io/"> <u>project website</u> </a>for more information!
