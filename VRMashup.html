							This page presents and gives a brief summary for two of my recent projects relating to VR.
							Both projects took place during autumn 2022 (November-Decemeber)

							<br>
							<h4> Shooter:Unknown</h4>

								Shooter:Unknown is the second project completed for the Advanced Graphics and Interaction course at KTH. The project was centered around an intense two-player cooperative action game 
								in which one player controlled a character weilding two pistols, while the other player (or players) controlled a drone. The goal of the pistol-weilding player in VR was to blast their way
								through a level filled with enemies. Meanwhile, the goal for the player(/players) was to control a drone using various body gestures in front of a tracking camera to grant various buffs to the
								player in VR.

								<h4> Mocap Project - Measuring precision in Desktop vs VR</h4>
								This project presented a great opportunity of working with VR in a more academic context. At the heart of the project was the question of how precision in annotating (marking) points  
								on either VR or desktop. During the project, a user study was carried out in which participants where tasked with reviewing a recording of motion captured data and, using VR controllers or keyboard and mouse,
								annotating exact points in time and space in the recording. 

								<br />
								<br />
								More information about the project can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/MarcusHolmbrg/TeamDreamMocapProject"><u>Github page</u></a><br>
								There is also a short demo video of the project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd4yNu-M8Yw"><u>Here</u></a>
